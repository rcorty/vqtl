    Trait Variance in Test Crosses

Description: In recognition that there are many factors (genetic loci, macro-
    genetic factors such as sex, and environmental factors) that influence the
    extent of environmental variation, the 'vqtl' package conducts genome scans
    that accommodate and target these factors. The main functions of this package,
    scanonevar() and scanonevar.perm() take as input a cross object from the popular
    'qtl' package.
